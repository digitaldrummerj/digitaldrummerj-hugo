I have been programming and designing web applications for over 20 years.  I love to share my knowledge with others to help get you to your end goal faster.  I am a frequent speaker at conferences, meetups and community events.  I am also part of the Arizona Give Camp organization where they put on hackathons for developers to code it forward to help Non-Profits with their IT needs.  

I currently live in Maricopa, Arizona with my wife and daughter.  I have worked at Intel for almost 20 years.  At Intel, I am part of amazing department called Freelance Nation where we get to Freelance around the company picking work that intersects with our passions, skills and company needs while passing on the work that doesn't excite us.  

If you would like me to speak at your event, please [drop me a line]({{< relref "contact.md" >}}).  I can cover pretty much any topic you see me blog about but feel free to request just about anything.  

If you've attended one of my talks, please send me your [feedback or suggestions]({{< relref "contact.md" >}}). 

If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.
